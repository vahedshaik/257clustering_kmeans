Business Objective:

Sales prediction Using big mart Data:

The dataset is of Big mart, a retail outlet. This dataset constitutes various details about the items sold, the outlets locations, total sales value of the outlet for a given item. This data can be used for predict the future sales of these outlets. This prediction finally can help management takecareful decisions on selling more of the items in high demand and also helps make decisions on outlets, items which are not performing well. This prediction can also determine if the oulet performs as per expectations.

The clusters below, and plots drawn help make some decisions and devise some strategies like:

1.The clusters are arranged according to the volume of their sales. This aids in our comprehension so that we may develop marketing plans properly.

2.The stores, locations, and item types in the cluster 0 contribute the least to overall sales value. As a result, we may develop a strategy to boost sales in these areas and item types.

3.Because cluster 1's stores, locations, and item types generate the highest revenue, we can add more of those types, locations, and item types.

4.Sales of low visibility items outpace those of high visibility items. This understanding can be used to guide decisions.

In addition to clutsers, projections of sales performance for future years and outlets allow businesses to plan accordingly.
